# .voidrules

# This file defines custom rules and guidelines for the MyPrompt project
# within the Void IDE.

# BE SURE TO RUN ALL TERMINAL COMMANDS WITHIN THE UV ENVIRONMENT!!
# This requires running the command '.venv/Scripts/activate' 
# upon initialization of a new terminal session. Any dependancy installation
# must be done within the virtual environment. Additionally, all commands that
# use those dependancies must be run within the uv virtual enviornment. Please
# be sure to do everything that you can within the virtual environment by running
# '.venv/Scripts/activate' when you begin a new terminal session.

# Testing Guidelines:
# - All new code should be accompanied by relevant unit or integration tests
#   to ensure functionality and prevent regressions.
# - Tests for removed or significantly changed code should be updated or
#   deleted to reflect the current state of the codebase.
# - Aim for good test coverage, focusing on critical paths and complex logic.

# You can add more specific rules here later, potentially integrating with
# testing frameworks or linters if Void supports that through this file.
# For example:
# lint:
#   rules:
#     no-unused-vars: error
#     prefer-const: warn
